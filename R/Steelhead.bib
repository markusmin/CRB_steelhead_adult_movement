abstract = {Mitigation and ecosystem-restoration efforts may have unintended consequences on both target and nontarget populations. Important effects can be displaced in space and time, making them difficult to detect without monitoring at appropriate scales. Here, we examined the effects of a mitigation program for juvenile salmonids on subsequent adult migration behaviors and survival. Juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) were collected and uniquely tagged with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags at Lower Granite Dam (Washington State, USA) on the Snake River and were then either transported downstream in barges in an effort to reduce out-migration mortality or returned to the river as a control group. Returning adults were collected and radio-tagged at Bonneville Dam (Washington-Oregon, USA) on the Columbia River 1-3 years later and then monitored during ;460 km of their homing migrations. The proportion of adults successfully homing was significantly lower, and unaccounted loss and permanent straying into non-natal rivers was higher, for barged fish of both species. On average, barged fish homed to Lower Granite Dam at rates about 10% lower than for in-river migrants. Barged fish were also 1.7-3.4 times more likely than in-river fish to fall back downstream past dams as adults, a behavior strongly associated with lower survival. These results suggest that juvenile transport impaired adult orientation or homing abilities, perhaps by disrupting sequential imprinting processes during juvenile out-migration. While juvenile transportation has clear short-term juvenilesurvival benefits, the delayed effects that manifest in adult stages illustrate the need to assess mitigation success throughout the life cycle of target organisms, i.e., the use of fitness-based measures. In the case of Snake River salmonids listed under the Endangered Species Act, the increased straying and potential associated genetic and demographic effects may represent significant risks to successful recovery for both target and nontarget populations. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Water temperature is a primary physical factor regulating the persistence and distribution of aquatic taxa. Considering projected increases in air temperature and changes in precipitation in the coming century, accurate assessment of suitable thermal habitats in freshwater systems is critical for predicting aquatic species' responses to changes in climate and for guiding adaptation strategies. We use a hydrologic model coupled with a stream temperature model and downscaled general circulation model outputs to explore the spatially and temporally varying changes in stream temperature for the late 21st century at the subbasin and ecological province scale for the Columbia River basin (CRB). On average, stream temperatures are projected to increase 3.5 °C for the spring, 5.2 °C for the summer, 2.7 °C for the fall, and 1.6 °C for the winter. While results indicate changes in stream temperature are correlated with changes in air temperature, our results also capture the important, and often ignored, influence of hydrological processes on changes in stream temperature. Decreases in future snowcover will result in increased thermal sensitivity within regions that were previously buffered by the cooling effect of flow originating as snowmelt. Other hydrological components, such as precipitation, surface runoff, lateral soil water flow, and groundwater inflow, are negatively correlated to increases in stream temperature depending on the ecological province and season. At the ecological province scale, the largest increase in annual stream temperature was within the Mountain Snake ecological province, which is characterized by migratory coldwater fish species. Stream temperature changes varied seasonally with the largest projected stream temperature increases occurring during the spring and summer for all ecological provinces. Our results indicate that stream temperatures are driven by local processes and ultimately require a physically explicit modeling approach to accurately characterize the habitat regulating the distribution and diversity of aquatic taxa.},

abstract = {The importance of thermal refuges in a rapidly warming world is particularly evident for migratory species, where individuals encounter a wide range of conditions throughout their lives. In this study, we used a spatially explicit, individual‐based simulation model to evaluate the buffering potential of cold‐water thermal refuges for anadromous salmon and trout (Oncorhynchus spp.) migrating upstream through a warm river corridor that can expose individuals to physiologically stressful temperatures. We considered upstream migration in relation to migratory phenotypes that were defined in terms of migration timing, spawn timing, swim speed, and use of cold‐water thermal refuges. Individuals with different migratory phenotypes migrated upstream through riverine corridors with variable availability of cold‐water thermal refuges and mainstem temperatures. Use of cold‐water refuges (CWRs) decreased accumulated sublethal exposures to physiologically stressful temperatures when measured in degree‐days above 20, 21, and 22°C. The availability of CWRs was an order of magnitude more effective in lowering accumulated sublethal exposures under current and future mainstem temperatures for summer steelhead than fall Chinook Salmon. We considered two emergent model outcomes, survival and percent of available energy used, in relation to thermal heterogeneity and migratory phenotype. Mean percent energy loss attributed to future warmer mainstem temperatures was at least two times larger than the difference in energy used in simulations without CWRs for steelhead and salmon. We also found that loss of CWRs reduced the diversity of energy‐conserving migratory phenotypes when we examined the variability in entry timing and travel time outside of CWRs in relation to energy loss. Energy‐conserving phenotypic space contracted by 7%–23% when CWRs were unavailable under the current thermal regime. Our simulations suggest that, while CWRs do not entirely mitigate for stressful thermal exposures in mainstem rivers, these features are important for maintaining a diversity of migration phenotypes. Our study suggests that the maintenance of diverse portfolios of migratory phenotypes and cool‐ and cold‐water refuges might be added to the suite of policies and management actions presently being deployed to improve the likelihood of Pacific salmonid persistence into a future characterized by climate change.},

abstract = {Dams are obstructing rivers worldwide, impairing habitat and migration opportunities for many freshwater fish species; however, global data linking dam and fish distributions have been limited. Here, we quantify dam obstruction at the biogeographic scale of freshwater ecoregion, which provides the spatial framework necessary to assess the risk of fish species loss due to dams and allows us to identify both ecoregions and genera at risk. Nearly 50% of the 397 assessed freshwater ecoregions are obstructed by large-and medium-size dams, and approximately 27% face additional downstream obstruction. A synthesis of obstruction data and fish traits indicates that taxa such as lampreys (Lampetra spp.), eels (Anguilla spp.), and shads (Alosa spp.) are at particular risk of species loss. Threatened ecoregions with heavy dam obstruction and above-average counts of total, diadromous, or endemic species are found on all continents and include the MurrayDarling Province, Southern Italy, the Lower and Middle Indus Basin, West Korea, the South Atlantic region of the United States, the Upper Paran, and Mobile Bay ecoregions. {\textcopyright} 2012 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.},

abstract = {Organisms often rely on environmental cues to make behavioral and life-history decisions. However, in environments that have been altered suddenly by humans, formerly reliable cues might no longer be associated with adaptive outcomes. In such cases, organisms can become 'trapped' by their evolutionary responses to the cues and experience reduced survival or reproduction. Ecological traps occur when organisms make poor habitat choices based on cues that correlated formerly with habitat quality. Ecological traps are part of a broader phenomenon, evolutionary traps, involving a dissociation between cues that organisms use to make any behavioral or life-history decision and outcomes normally associated with that decision. A trap can lead to extinction if a population falls below a critical size threshold before adaptation to the novel environment occurs. Conservation and management protocols must be designed in light of, rather than in spite of, the behavioral mechanisms and evolutionary history of populations and species to avoid 'trapping' them.},

abstract = {Tributary overshoot occurs when adult salmonids homing to natal sites continue upstream past the mouth of their natal stream. Although overshooting is a common behavior by steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Columbia River basin, it has not been adequately quantified or explained. Using multistate release–recapture models, we examined the prevalence of overshooting and fallback to natal tributaries by 37,806 PIT-tagged steelhead from 14 tributaries of the Columbia River basin during 2005–2015. Eight populations had overshooting rates exceeding 50% in at least 1 year. Source of hatchery stock, rearing location, and release practices were found to have appreciable effects on overshoot rates. Overshooting was elevated in hatchery stocks reared upstream of release sites, but this effect may be lessened by utilizing endemic broodstocks and acclimating juveniles within the release basin. For one population of hatchery steelhead, acclimation within the release basin was found to decrease overshooting from 81% to 40%. Across both hatchery and wild populations, successful homing was found to decline 4 percentage points for every 5-percentage-point increase in overshoot rate. Average annual fallback probabilities ranged from 0.18 for Walla Walla River hatchery steelhead to 0.75 for Umatilla River wild steelhead. Fish stocks with the greatest fallback probabilities also had the greatest interannual variability in fallback rates. For John Day River wild steelhead and Tucannon River hatchery steelhead, the interannual range in fallback probabilities exceeded 0.50. We found evidence that spill at dams during March may enhance the fallback of overshooting steelhead and contribute to increased homing to natal tributaries. Therefore, additional attention should be paid to facilitating downstream dam passage of adult salmon.},

abstract = {Sluiceways at hydroelectric dams are designed to enable floating ice and debris to pass through the dams and may be used as an effective, nonturbine, surface route for out-migrating fishes to pass through dams. Each year, the sluiceway at The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River, USA, is normally operated between 1 April and 30 November and the spillway between 10 April and 31 August to enable downstream-migrating juvenile Pacific salmonids to pass. The only route available for fishes to pass the dam between 1 December and 31 March is through the turbines. This study evaluated downstream passage of adult steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss at The Dalles Dam during various periods between 1 November and 10 April for years 2008 through 2010. The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of operating the sluiceway between 1 December and 31 March to provide a relatively safe, nonturbine, surface outlet for downstream passage of adult steelhead that overwinter in the lower Columbia River (i.e., fallbacks) or for adult steelhead attempting to emigrate back to the marine environment after spawning (i.e., kelts). We applied a fixed-location hydroacoustic technique to estimate downstream passage rates at the sluiceway and turbines. The sluiceway was used by 91-99% of the adult steelhead during all sampling periods; the remaining 1-9% passed through the turbines. This implies that adult steelhead preferred the sluiceway for downstream passage at the dam. Our results indicate that keeping the sluiceway open between 1 December and 31 March may provide an optimal, nonturbine surface route for downstream passage of overwintering or postspawned adult steelhead at The Dalles Dam. Similar operations are relevant at hydroelectric dams with surface-flow outlets, such as sluiceways, for safe downstream passage of fish species of management concern. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Declining trends are observed across all months, states, and climates, but are largest in spring, in the Pacific states, and in locations with mild winter climate. We corroborate and extend these observations using a gridded hydrology model, which also allows a robust estimate of total western snowpack and its decline. We find a large increase in the fraction of locations that posted decreasing trends, and averaged across the western US, the decline in average April 1 snow water equivalent since mid-century is roughly 15–30% or 25–50 km3, comparable in volume to the West's largest man-made reservoir, Lake Mead.},

abstract = {We used radiotelemetry to evaluate the temporary staging of adult migrating steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss into nonnatal tributary rivers of the Columbia River and to determine the effects of staging behavior on migration rate. By monitoring the movement patterns of 2,900 individual steelhead over 3 years (1996, 1997, and 2000), we determined that an average of 61% of the steelhead destined for upstream areas temporarily staged in one or more tributaries in the lower Columbia River for durations from less than 1 h to 237 d. Median residence time varied significantly by tributary used and year and, based on canonical correlation analysis, was correlated with main-stem Columbia River water temperature. Steelhead that temporarily staged in tributary rivers migrated through the lower Columbia River significantly more slowly than steelhead that did not use tributaries. Use of coolwater tributaries as thermal refugia during warm summertime conditions significantly influences the migratory behavior of Columbia River adult steelhead. Our results highlight the need to preserve the water quality parameters of existing cooler-water Columbia River tributaries and to rehabilitate watersheds that historically maintained cooler-water tributaries as sources of thermal refugia for adult summer steelhead returning to the basin.},

abstract = {This study investigates the impact of both air temperature and river discharge changes on daily water temperatures for river stations globally. A nonlinear water temperature regression model was adapted to include discharge as a variable in addition to air temperature, and a time lag was incorporated to apply the model on a daily basis. The performance of the model was tested for a selection of study basin stations and 157 river temperature stations globally using historical series of daily river temperature, air temperature, and river discharge for the 1980-1999 period. For the study basin stations and for 87% of the global river stations, the performance of the model improved by including discharge as an input variable. Greatest improvements were found during heat wave and drought (low flow) conditions, when water temperatures are most sensitive to atmospheric influences and can reach critically high values. A sensitivity analysis showed increases in annual mean river temperatures of +1.3 C, +2.6°C, and +3.8°C under air temperature increases of +2°C, +4°C, and +6°C, respectively. Discharge decreases of 20% and 40% exacerbated water temperature increases by +0.3°C and +0.8°C on average. For several stations, maximum water temperatures on a daily basis were higher under an air temperature increase of +4°C combined with a 40% discharge decrease compared to an air temperature increase of +6°C (without discharge changes). Impacts of river discharge on water temperatures should therefore be incorporated to provide more accurate estimations of river temperatures during historical and future projected dry and warm periods.

Social–ecological interactions among stakeholders often complicate natural-resource conservation and management of riverscapes. The management challenges posed by the conservation and restoration of wild salmonid populations in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) of western North America are one such example. Because of their ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic importance, salmonids present a complex management landscape due to interacting environmental factors (eg climate change, invasive species) as well as socioeconomic and political factors (eg dams, hatcheries, land-use change, transboundary agreements). Many of the problems in the CRB can be linked to social–ecological interactions occurring within integrated ecological, human–social, and regional–climatic spheres. Future management and conservation of salmonid populations therefore depends on how well the issues are understood and whether they can be resolved through effective communication and collaboration among ecologists, social scientists, stakeholders, and policy makers.},

abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

Migration success rates from LGR to the study area exit (8 km east of Portland, Oregon) were poorer during the low-flow nonspill conditions of 2001 (4.1%) than in the more typical flow year of 2002 (15.6%). Kelts tagged and released at Columbia River dams had substantially higher migration success than those released on the Snake River; 59.6% and 62.3% of the kelts released at McN and 63.6% and 80.0% of those released at JDD were contacted at the study area exit during 2001 and 2002, respectively. Kelt dam passage was predominately via spillways and surface flow routes, and during periods of spill 90.0% or more kelts typically passed via nonturbine routes. Only 47.2% of kelts were guided out of turbine intakes by screen systems during nonspill periods. Turbine passage, the primary alternative route during nonspill periods, may be a substantial source of kelt mortality. The poor migration success rate of Snake River kelts in both 2001 and 2002 suggests that additional management (i.e., kelt reconditioning, transportation, or both) may be warranted to boost iteroparity rates in this population.},

We used radiotelemetry and a fishery reward program to calculate escapement, harvest, and unaccounted for loss rates for 10 498 adult chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and 5324 steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during six return years in the Columbia River basin. Mean annual escapements to spawning sites, hatcheries, or the upper bounds of the monitored hydrosystem were 73.4% (spring-summer chinook salmon), 61.3% (fall chinook salmon), and 62.6% (steelhead). Mean reported harvest rates were 8.7% (spring-summer chinook), 22.0% (fall chinook), and 15.1% (steelhead) within the mainstem hydrosystem and 5.9%, 3.4%, and 5.7%, respectively, in lower hydrosystem tributaries. On average, 12%-17% of each run had unknown fates in the mainstem hydrosystem. Escapement, harvest, and loss varied significantly between runs and years, within runs between known-origin subbasin stocks, and between interdam river reaches. Multiyear quantitative assessments like this can reduce uncertainty, clarify inter- and intra-annual variability, and help managers better evaluate fisheries, identify conservation priorities, and help protect evolutionarily significant populations. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC.},

Infrastructure development threatens the ecosystem processes, biodiversity and services that these rivers support. Here we assess the connectivity status of 12 million kilometres of rivers globally and identify those that remain free-flowing in their entire length. Only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length and 23 per cent flow uninterrupted to the ocean. Very long FFRs are largely restricted to remote regions of the Arctic and of the Amazon and Congo basins. In densely populated areas only few very long rivers remain free-flowing, such as the Irrawaddy and Salween. Dams and reservoirs and their up- and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to the loss of river connectivity. By applying a new method to quantify riverine connectivity and map FFRs, we provide a foundation for concerted global and national strategies to maintain or restore them.},

abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01% of the World's water and approximately 0.8% of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6% of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'. {\textcopyright} 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

In response to this need, major new initiatives in hydropower development are now under way. At least 3,700 major dams, each with a capacity of more than 1 MW, are either planned or under construction, primarily in countries with emerging economies. These dams are predicted to increase the present global hydroelectricity capacity by 73 % to about 1,700 GW. Even such a dramatic expansion in hydropower capacity will be insufficient to compensate for the increasing electricity demand. Furthermore, it will only partially close the electricity gap, may not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emission (carbon dioxide and methane), and may not erase interdependencies and social conflicts. At the same time, it is certain to reduce the number of our planet's remaining free-flowing large rivers by about 21 %. Clearly, there is an urgent need to evaluate and to mitigate the social, economic, and ecological ramifications of the current boom in global dam construction.},

abstract = {Most modeling and statistical approaches encourage simplicity, yet ecological processes are often complex, as they are influenced by numerous dynamic environmental and biological factors. Pacific salmon abundance has been highly variable over the last few decades and most forecasting models have proven inadequate, primarily because of a lack of understanding of the processes affecting variability in survival. Better methods and data for predicting the abundance of returning adults are therefore required to effectively manage the species. We combined 31 distinct indicators of the marine environment collected over an 11-year period into a multivariate analysis to summarize and predict adult spring Chinook salmon returns to the Columbia River in 2012. In addition to forecasts, this tool quantifies the strength of the relationship between various ecological indicators and salmon returns, allowing interpretation of ecosystem processes. The relative importance of indicators varied, but a few trends emerged. Adult returns of spring Chinook salmon were best described using indicators of bottom-up ecological processes such as composition and abundance of zooplankton and fish prey as well as measures of individual fish, such as growth and condition. Local indicators of temperature or coastal upwelling did not contribute as much as large-scale indicators of temperature variability, matching the spatial scale over which salmon spend the majority of their ocean residence. Results suggest that effective management of Pacific salmon requires multiple types of data and that no single indicator can represent the complex early-ocean ecology of salmon.},

abstract = {The mandate to increase endangered salmon populations in the Columbia River Basin of North America has created a complex, controversial resource-management issue. We constructed an integrated assessment model as a tool for analyzing biological-economic trade-offs in recovery of Snake River spring- and summer-run chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We merged 3 frameworks: a salmon-passage model to predict migration and survival of smolts; an age-structured matrix model to predict long-term population growth rates of salmon stocks; and a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine a set of least-cost management alternatives for achieving particular population growth rates. We assessed 6 individual salmon-management measures and 76 management alternatives composed of one or more measures. To reflect uncertainty, results were derived for different assumptions of effectiveness of smolt transport around dams. Removal of an estuarine predator, the Caspian Tern (Sterna caspia), was cost-effective and generally increased long-term population growth rates regardless of transport effectiveness. Elimination of adult salmon harvest had a similar effect over a range of its cost estimates. The specific management alternatives in the cost-effective set depended on assumptions about transport effectiveness. On the basis of recent estimates of smolt transport effectiveness, alternatives that discontinued transportation or breached dams were prevalent in the cost-effective set, whereas alternatives that maximized transportation dominated if transport effectiveness was relatively high. More generally, the analysis eliminated 80-90% of management alternatives from the cost-effective set. Application of our results to salmon management is limited by data availability and model assumptions, but these limitations can help guide research that addresses critical uncertainties and information. Our results thus demonstrate that linking biology and economics through integrated models can provide valuable tools for science-based policy and management.},

abstract = {Fresh waters are particularly vulnerable to climate change because (i) many species within these fragmented habitats have limited abilities to disperse as the environment changes; (ii) water temperature and availability are climate-dependent; and (iii) many systems are already exposed to numerous anthropogenic stressors. Most climate change studies to date have focused on individuals or species populations, rather than the higher levels of organization (i.e. communities, food webs, ecosystems). We propose that an understanding of the connections between these different levels, which are all ultimately based on individuals, can help to develop a more coherent theoretical framework based on metabolic scaling, foraging theory and ecological stoichiometry, to predict the ecological consequences of climate change. For instance, individual basal metabolic rate scales with body size (which also constrains food web structure and dynamics) and temperature (which determines many ecosystem processes and key aspects of foraging behaviour). In addition, increasing atmospheric CO2 is predicted to alter molar CNP ratios of detrital inputs, which could lead to profound shifts in the stoichiometry of elemental fluxes between consumers and resources at the base of the food web. The different components of climate change (e.g. temperature, hydrology and atmospheric composition) not only affect multiple levels of biological organization, but they may also interact with the many other stressors to which fresh waters are exposed, and future research needs to address these potentially important synergies. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The temperature of river water plays a crucial role in many physical, chemical, and aquatic ecological processes. Despite the importance of having detailed information on this environmental variable at locally relevant scales (≤50 km), high-resolution simulations of water temperature on a large scale are currently lacking. We have developed the dynamical 1-D water energy routing model (DynWat), that solves both the energy and water balance, to simulate river temperatures for the period 1960–2014 at a nominal 10-km and 50-km resolution. The DynWat model accounts for surface water abstraction, reservoirs, riverine flooding, and formation of ice, enabling a realistic representation of the water temperature. We present a novel 10-km water temperature data set at the global scale for all major rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Validated results against 358 stations worldwide indicate a decrease in the simulated root-mean-square error (0.2 °C) and bias (0.7 °C), going from 50- to 10-km simulations. We find an average global increase in water temperature of 0.16 °C per decade between 1960 and 2014, with more rapid warming toward 2014. Results show increasing trends for the annual daily maxima in the Northern Hemisphere (0.62 °C per decade) and the annual daily minima in the Southern Hemisphere (0.45 °C per decade) for 1960–2014. The high-resolution modeling framework not only improves the model performance, it also positively impacts the relevance of the simulations for regional-scale studies and impact assessments in a region without observations. The resulting global water temperature data set could help to improve the accuracy of decision-support systems that depend on water temperature estimates.},

abstract = {In the 12 years since Dudgeon et al. (2006) reviewed major pressures on freshwater ecosystems, the biodiversity crisis in the world's lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands has deepened. While lakes, reservoirs and rivers cover only 2.3% of the Earth's surface, these ecosystems host at least 9.5% of the Earth's described animal species. Furthermore, using the World Wide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index, freshwater population declines (83% between 1970 and 2014) continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The Anthropocene has brought multiple new and varied threats that disproportionately impact freshwater systems. We document 12 emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity that are either entirely new since 2006 or have since intensified: (i) changing climates; (ii) e-commerce and invasions; (iii) infectious diseases; (iv) harmful algal blooms; (v) expanding hydropower; (vi) emerging contaminants; (vii) engineered nanomaterials; (viii) microplastic pollution; (ix) light and noise; (x) freshwater salinisation; (xi) declining calcium; and (xii) cumulative stressors. Effects are evidenced for amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, microbes, plants, turtles and waterbirds, with potential for ecosystem-level changes through bottom-up and top-down processes. In our highly uncertain future, the net effects of these threats raise serious concerns for freshwater ecosystems. However, we also highlight opportunities for conservation gains as a result of novel management tools (e.g. environmental flows, environmental DNA) and specific conservation-oriented actions (e.g. dam removal, habitat protection policies, managed relocation of species) that have been met with varying levels of success.

abstract = {Steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss is a species that is of high economic value that supports popular sport fisheries across the Pacific Northwest. The Clearwater River in Idaho provides a trophy steelhead fishery, and it is home to both wild- and hatchery-origin steelhead. To manage the fishery effectively, information is needed about the spatial and temporal overlap of wild and hatchery steelhead in the Clearwater River, as well as the activity of anglers. We conducted a radiotelemetry study to describe the distribution of steelhead and their final fate in the Clearwater River, and creel surveys were used to describe the distribution of anglers. In total, 289 wild (Potlatch River and Lochsa River) and hatchery (from Dworshak National Fish Hatchery and South Fork Clearwater River) steelhead were radio-tagged at Lower Granite Dam, 51 river kilometers (rkm) downstream from the mouth of the Clearwater River. Fish were monitored upon their entry into the Clearwater River by using mobile tracking surveys (boat and vehicle) and stationary antennas. The majority of wild and hatchery steelhead arrived in the Clearwater River in the fall with the exception of those from the Lochsa River, which arrived in the fall and following spring. Average daily movement of the fish was minimal (range = 0.3–4.7 km/d) and dependent on water temperature and flow. The fates of wild and hatchery steelhead varied. Fish returned to spawning grounds, were harvested by anglers (hatchery fish only), or had unknown fates. Both wild and hatchery steelhead returned at high rates to their natal tributaries and release locations. No straying was observed in either group; however, occasions when steelhead have overshot their natal tributaries and release locations were documented. Spatial and temporal overlap of the distributions of wild and hatchery steelhead was minimal. The distribution of anglers overlapped with that of hatchery steelhead in the fall, winter, and spring. The distributional overlap of anglers and wild steelhead was minimal and largely occurred in September in the lower Clearwater River. This suggests that the Clearwater River has a highly compartmentalized fishery and that current fishing regulations in the Clearwater River are providing for a diversity of angling opportunities while conserving wild steelhead and offering harvest of hatchery fish. The results from this study have important implications for the conservation and management of wild and hatchery steelhead.},

Although the FCRPS dams produce a wealth of hydropower, the mortalities they cause due to the construction and operation of FCRPS dams led to Endangered Species Act listings for the basin's salmon. Since those listings a quarter-century ago, the federal government has repeatedly failed to produce biological opinions that can survive judicial scrutiny. The latest round of litigation resulted in renewed directives from the federal district court of Oregon to revise the current biological opinion and to spill more water at several dams in the interim to facilitate juvenile salmon migration. The directive to increase spill was upheld by the Ninth Circuit in 2018, but the U.S. House of Representatives quickly voted to overturn that decision, and the Senate now has the matter under consideration.},

In systems supporting mixed populations of fisheries and conservation importance, understanding the distribution and survival of pre- and postspawn fish is necessary for informed management. The upper Columbia River supports hatchery-origin components valued by anglers, natural-origin components of conservation concern, and temporary strays from downstream populations. We used radiotelemetry and PIT telemetry to monitor the behavior, distribution, and survival of adult steelhead during fall, overwintering, spawning, and postspawn periods, with a focus on use of the main stem versus four major tributaries. Adult steelhead (N = 807) were tagged at Priest Rapids Dam in 2015 and 2016. One-fifth of steelhead fell back below Priest Rapids Dam and did not reascend. A slight majority of tagged steelhead that overwintered upstream of Priest Rapids Dam did so in main-stem reservoirs (54%; N = 548). Overwintering in the main-stem Columbia River was more likely for later-arriving steelhead and was concentrated in the upstream-most reservoir. Winter tributary use was highest in the Wenatchee (26%; 2016) and Methow (18%; 2015) rivers, whereas no steelhead overwintered in the Entiat River. Harvest of hatchery-origin steelhead was 18% in 2015 and was near zero in 2016, when the fishery was suspended due to low adult returns. After accounting for reported harvest, annual overwinter survival did not differ between main-stem and tributary habitats, and relatively low adjusted survival of hatchery-origin steelhead in 2015 suggested unreported harvest. In contrast to low iteroparity rates (<3%), the majority of postspawn steelhead (56.5%) exited tributaries as kelts; kelt survival to Bonneville Dam was 65% in 2016 and 23% in 2017. Collectively, the results highlight the importance of understanding patterns of habitat use and mortality in steelhead populations when managers are faced with balancing harvest and conservation goals.},

abstract = {Successful migration of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) smolts seaward in the Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta (hereafter, Delta) requires navigating a network of numerous branching channels. Within the Delta, several key junctions route smolts either towards more direct paths to the ocean or towards the interior Delta, an area associated with decreased survival. Movements within these junctions that determine route choice can be influenced by numerous behavioral and environmental factors, including the complex interplay between tidal and riverine hydraulics. Here, we apply continuous time multistate Markov models to examine the influence of tidal and riverine hydraulics, behavioral factors, and management actions on smolt movements. These models incorporate more information from acoustic telemetry data compared with previous approaches to modeling smolt movements in the Delta. By decomposing modeled flows into tidal and net flow signals we elucidate how each component influences movements into and out of distributary channels. Increasing net flows generally increased movement rates, while flood tides decreased seaward movement rates. Similarly, ebb tides increased downstream movements as fish go with the flow. We found less support for diel movement behaviors compared to flow metrics. Additionally, we quantify the effects of a large management action, the placement of a physical barrier, which was effective at decreasing entrainment into the interior Delta. Together, these results help inform management of Chinook Salmon and increase our understanding of the major factors driving smolt movements within these key junctions.},

abstract = {There is a long research history addressing olfactory imprinting, natal homing, and non-natal straying by anadromous salmon and trout (Salmonidae). In undisturbed populations, adult straying is a fundamental component of metapopulation biology, facilitating genetic resilience, demographic stability, recolonization, and range expansion into unexploited habitats. Unfortunately, salmonid hatcheries and other human actions worldwide have affected straying in ways that can negatively affect wild populations through competitive interactions, reduced productivity and resiliency, hybridization and domestication effects, and outbreeding depression. Reduced adult straying is therefore an objective for many managed populations. Currently, there is considerable uncertainty about the range of 'natural' stray rates and about which mechanisms precipitate straying in either wild or human-influenced fish. Research in several disciplines indicates that adult straying is affected by endocrine physiology and neurological processes in juveniles, incomplete or interrupted imprinting during rearing and emigration, and by complex interactions among adult maturation processes, reproductive behaviors, olfactory memory, environmental conditions during migration, and senescence physiology. Reported salmonid stray rates indicate that the behavior varies among species, among life-history types, and among populations within species. Most strays enter sites near natal areas, but long-distance straying also occurs, especially in hatchery populations that were outplanted or transported as juveniles. A majority of past studies has estimated straying as demographic losses from donor populations, but some have estimated straying into recipient populations. Most recipient-based estimates have substantiated concerns that wild populations are vulnerable to swamping by abundant hatchery and farm-raised strays. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic impacts on riverine systems have, in part, led to management concerns regarding the population status of species using these systems. In an effort to assess the efficacy of restoration actions, and in order to improve monitoring of species of concern, managers have turned to PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag studies with in-stream detectors to monitor movements of tagged individuals throughout river networks. However, quantifying movements in a river network using PIT tag data with incomplete coverage and imperfect detections presents a challenge. We propose a flexible Bayesian analytic framework that models the imperfectly detected movements of tagged individuals in a nested PIT tag array river network. This model structure provides probabilistic estimates of up-stream migration routes for each tagged individual based on a set of underlying nested state variables. These movement estimates can be converted into abundance estimates when an estimate of abundance is available for a location within the river network. We apply the model framework to data from steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Upper Columbia River basin and evaluate model performance (precision/variance of simulated population sizes) as a function of population tagging rates and PIT tag array detection probability densities within the river system using a simulation framework. This simulation framework provides both model validation (precision) and the ability to evaluate expected performance improvements (variance) due to changes in tagging rates or PIT receiver array configuration. We also investigate the impact of different network configurations on model estimates. Results from such investigations can help inform decisions regarding future monitoring and management.},

abstract = {Hydropower plants have been developed globally to provide renewable energy, increase water supply and help with flood control. Meanwhile, hydropower impacts on riverscape and aquatic species are widely documented. However, little attention has been paid to impacts on large semi-aquatic animals such as crocodylians, turtles, and otters, which are prone to environmental changes associated with hydropower development. We conducted a systematic mapping of evidence documented in the published literature and synthesised the effects of hydropower development on semi-aquatic megafauna (i.e., semi-aquatic animals with a reported maximum body mass ≥ 30 kg). We identified 68 relevant impact records from 30 studies, which demonstrated that hydropower plants profoundly altered the habitats of semi-aquatic megafauna and affected their interactions with humans and domestic animals. Hydropower plants posed adverse impacts on the distribution, fitness, movement, nutrition, and reproduction of semi-aquatic megafauna. Positive impacts, such as increased suitable habitats and available food resources associated with land cover change, were also observed in some instances. Our study reveals a considerable information gap on effects of hydropower development at the land-water interface and underscores the gaps in current assessments, such as the lack of monitoring schemes that compare the situations of semi-aquatic species before and after dam construction. It also emphasises priority regions for monitoring and conservation schemes, particularly in tropic regions that are experiencing rapid hydropower development. We highlight the need to incorporate hydropower impacts on semi-aquatic animals into planning and management of renewable energy infrastructure for better informed decisions on energy production and biodiversity conservation.},

When main stem temperatures were warmest (i.e., >21 8C), more than 70% of the tagged fish used refugia sites and these fish had median refugia residence times of 3-4 weeks. Thermoregulatory responses were similar across populations, but there were large among-population differences in the incidence and duration of refugia use likely linked to population-specific migration timing patterns. In survival analyses using 1285 known-origin steelhead, fish that used thermal refugia were significantly less likely to survive to natal basins, were harvested at relatively high rates in refugia tributaries, and had greater unknown mortality in the main stem. These results highlight the trade-off between the presumed physiological benefits of thermal refugia use and a likely increase in harvest and other mortality risks that arise when preferred thermal habitats are severely constricted.},

abstract = {Rising river temperatures in western North America have increased the energetic costs of migration and the risk of premature mortality in many Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations. Predicting and managing risks for these populations requires data on acute and cumulative thermal exposure, the spatio-temporal distribution of adverse conditions, and the potentially mitigating effects of cool-water refuges. In this study, we paired radiotelemetry with archival temperature loggers to construct continuous, spatially-explicit thermal histories for 212 adult Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and 200 adult steelhead (O. mykiss). The fish amassed $\sim$500,000 temperature records (30-min intervals) while migrating through 470 kilometers of the Columbia and Snake rivers en route to spawning sites in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Spring- and most summer-run Chinook salmon migrated before river temperatures reached annual highs; their body temperatures closely matched ambient temperatures and most had thermal maxima in the lower Snake River. In contrast, many individual fall-run Chinook salmon and most steelhead had maxima near thermal tolerance limits (20–22 °C) in the lower Columbia River. High temperatures elicited extensive use of thermal refuges near tributary confluences, where body temperatures were $\sim$2–10 °C cooler than the adjacent migration corridor. Many steelhead used refuges for weeks or more whereas salmon use was typically hours to days, reflecting differences in spawn timing. Almost no refuge use was detected in a $\sim$260-km reach where a thermal migration barrier may more frequently develop in future warmer years. Within population, cumulative thermal exposure was strongly positively correlated (0.88 ≤ r ≤ 0.98) with migration duration and inconsistently associated (-0.28 ≤ r ≤ 0.09) with migration date. All four populations have likely experienced historically high mean and maximum temperatures in recent years. Expected responses include population-specific shifts in migration phenology, increased reliance on patchily-distributed thermal refuges, and natural selection favoring temperature-tolerant phenotypes.},

Using the migration times of passive integrated transponder (PIT)–tagged adult Chinook salmon upstream between Bonneville and Lower Granite dams (462 km) over the years 1998–2002, we found that a maximum swim speed of about 1 body length/s occurred at 16.3°C. Speed was less above and below this optimum temperature. For PIT-tagged steelhead, migration speed uniformly decreased with increasing temperature, suggesting that the fish migrated at temperatures above the optimum. Migration delay was also a unimodal function of temperature, the minimum delay occurring around 16–17°C. The broken linear model was compared with seven alternative models of unimodal and monotonic speed versus temperature and flow. The unimodal models fit the data better than the monotonic models (when ranked by the Akaike information criterion), and the broken linear model fit the data best. Flow was insignificant in all of the monotonic models and only marginally significant in the unimodal models. The findings of this study have significance in evaluating the effects of hydrosystem operations and climate change on salmon and steelhead fitness.},

abstract = {The USA and Canada have entered negotiations to modernize the Columbia River Treaty, signed in 1961. Key priorities are balancing flood risk and hydropower production, and improving aquatic ecosystem function while incorporating projected effects of climate change. In support of the US effort, Chegwidden et al. (2017) developed a large-ensemble dataset of past and future daily streamflows at 396 sites throughout the Columbia River basin (CRB) and selected other watersheds in western Washington and Oregon, using state-of-The art climate and hydrologic models. In this study, we use that dataset to present new analyses of the effects of future climate change on flooding using water year maximum daily streamflows. For each simulation, flood statistics are estimated from generalized extreme value distributions fit to simulated water year maximum daily streamflows for 50-year windows of the past (1950-1999) and future (2050-2099) periods. Our results contrast with previous findings: we find that the vast majority of locations in the CRB are estimated to experience an increase in future streamflow magnitudes. The near ubiquity of increases is all the more remarkable in that our approach explores a larger set of methodological variation than previous studies; however, like previous studies, our modeling system was not calibrated to minimize error in maximum daily streamflow and may be affected by unquantifiable errors. We show that on the Columbia and Willamette rivers increases in streamflow magnitudes are smallest downstream and grow larger moving upstream. For the Snake River, however, the pattern is reversed, with increases in streamflow magnitudes growing larger moving downstream to the confluence with the Salmon River tributary and then abruptly dropping. We decompose the variation in results attributable to variability in climate and hydrologic factors across the ensemble, finding that climate contributes more variation in larger basins, while hydrology contributes more in smaller basins. Equally important for practical applications like flood control rule curves, the seasonal timing of flooding shifts dramatically on some rivers (e.g., on the Snake, 20th-century floods occur exclusively in late spring, but by the end of the 21st century some floods occur as early as December) and not at all on others (e.g., the Willamette River).},

abstract = {Diadromous fish populations face multiple challenges along their migratory routes. These challenges include suboptimal water quality, harvest, and barriers to longitudinal and lateral connectivity. Interactions among factors influencing migration success make it challenging to assess management options for improving migratory fish conditions along riverine migration corridors. We describe a spatially explicit simulation model that integrates complex individual behaviors of fall-run Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and summer-run steelhead trout (O. mykiss) during migration, responds to variable habitat conditions over a large extent of the Columbia River, and links migration corridor conditions to fish condition outcomes. The model is built around a mechanistic behavioral decision tree that drives individual interactions of fish within their simulated environments. By simulating several thermalscapes with alternative scenarios of thermal refuge availability, we examined how behavioral thermoregulation in cold-water refuges influenced migrating fish conditions. Outcomes of the migration corridor simulation model show that cold-water refuges can provide relief from exposure to high water temperatures, but do not substantially contribute to energy conservation by migrating adults. Simulated cooling of the Columbia River decreased reliance on cold-water refuges and there were slight reductions in migratory energy expenditure. This modeling of simulated thermalscapes provides a framework for assessing the contribution of cold-water refuges to the success of migrating fishes, but any final determination will depend on analyzing fish survival and health for their entire migration, water temperature management goals and species recovery targets.},

Here we establish integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) as two powerful tools for modelling patterns of bycatch through time and space. These novel, computationally fast approaches are applied to fit zero-inflated hierarchical spatiotemporal models to Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) bycatch data from the Baffin Bay Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) gillnet fishery. Results indicate that Greenland shark bycatch is clustered in space and time, varies significantly from year to year, and there are both tractable factors (number of gillnet panels, total Greenland halibut catch) and physical features (bathymetry) leading to the high incidence of Greenland shark bycatch. Bycatch risk could be reduced by limiting access to spatiotemporal hotspots or by establishing a maximum number of panels per haul. Our method explicitly models the spatiotemporal correlation structure inherent in bycatch data at a very reasonable computational cost, such that the forecasting of bycatch patterns and simulating conservation strategies becomes more accessible.},

abstract = {The majority of Columbia River summer-run steelhead encounter high river temperatures (near or > 20C) during their spawning migration. While some steelhead pass through the mid-Columbia River in a matter of days, others use tributary habitats as temperature refuges for periods that can last months. Using PIT tag detection data from adult return years 2004–2016, we fit 3-component mixture models to differentiate between “fast”, “slow”, and “overwintering” migration behaviors in five aggregated population groups. Fast fish migrated straight through the reach on average in $\sim$7–9 days while slow fish delayed their migration for weeks to months, and overwintering fish generally took $\sim$150–250 days. We then fit covariate models to examine what factors contributed to the probability of migration delay during summer months (slow or overwintering behaviors), and to explore how migration delay related to mortality. Finally, to account for the impact of extended residence times in the reach for fish that delayed, we compared patterns in estimated average daily rates of mortality between migration behaviors and across population groups. Results suggest that migration delay was primarily triggered by high river temperatures but temperature thresholds for delay were lowest just before the seasonal peak in river temperatures. While all populations groups demonstrated these general patterns, we documented substantial variability in temperature thresholds and length of average delays across population groups. Although migration delay was related to higher reach mortality, it was also related to lower average daily mortality rates due to the proportional increase in reach passage duration being larger than the associated increase in mortality. Lower daily mortality rates suggest that migration delay could help mitigate the impacts of harsh migration conditions, presumably through the use of thermal refuges, despite prolonged exposure to local fisheries. Future studies tracking individual populations from their migration through reproduction could help illuminate the full extent of the tradeoffs between different migration behaviors.},

Emerging frameworks provide the opportunity to consider multiple river uses explicitly, but balancing multiple priorities remains challenging. Here we quantify relationships between hydrologic regimes and the abundance of multiple native and nonnative fish species over 18 years in a large, dryland river basin in southwestern United States. These models were incorporated into a multi-objective optimization framework to design dam operation releases that balance human water needs with the dual conservation targets of benefiting native fishes while disadvantaging nonnative fishes. Predicted designer flow prescriptions indicate significant opportunities to favor native over nonnative fishes while rarely, if ever, encroaching on human water needs. The predicted benefits surpass those generated by natural flow mimicry, and were retained across periods of heightened drought. We provide a quantitative illustration of theoretical predictions that designer flows can offer multiple ecological and societal benefits in human-altered rivers.},

abstract = {Mean summer water temperatures in the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada) have increased by $\sim$1.5 °C since the 1950s. In recent years, record high river temperatures during spawning migrations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) have been associated with high mortality events, raising concerns about long-term viability of the numerous natal stocks faced with climate warming. In this study, the effect of freshwater thermal experience on spawning migration survival was estimated by fitting capture-recapture models to telemetry data collected for 1474 adults (captured in either the ocean or river between 2002 and 2007) from four Fraser River sockeye salmon stock-aggregates (Chilko, Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams). Survival of Adams sockeye salmon was the most impacted by warm temperatures encountered in the lower river, followed by that of Stellako-Late Stuart and Quesnel. In contrast, survival of Chilko fish was insensitive to the encountered river temperature. In all stocks, in-river survival of ocean-captured sockeye salmon was higher than that of river-captured fish and, generally, the difference was more pronounced under warm temperatures. The survival-temperature relationships for ocean-captured fish were used to predict historic (1961-1990) and future (2010-2099) survival under simulated lower river thermal experiences for the Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams stocks. A decrease of 9-16% in survival of all these stocks was predicted by the end of the century if the Fraser River continues to warm as expected. However, the decrease in future survival of Adams sockeye salmon would occur only if fish continue to enter the river abnormally early, towards warmer periods of the summer, as they have done since 1995. The survival estimates and predictions presented here are likely optimistic and emphasize the need to consider stock-specific responses to temperature and climate warming into fisheries management and conservation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Hydropower structures hinder the movement and migration of fishes, impairing their life cycles. Additionally, downstream moving fish are often at risk of being injured during turbine passage. To improve hydropower production towards more fish-friendly techniques and management, knowledge on timing and extent of natural patterns of fish downstream movement is necessary. So far, migration behaviour of long-distance migrators such as eel or salmon has been well studied, but little is known about seasonal and diurnal movement patterns of nonmigratory species or medium-distance migrators. In this study, movement patterns of 39 fish species captured by stownets while transiting hydropower facilities in four impounded rivers were assessed and compared with the fish community composition directly upstream of the hydropower plants assessed by electrofishing. Strong differences between the fish community composition inhabiting the upstream sides of the dams and the fish detected in downstream passage were evident. In each study river, the downstream moving fish community composition differed significantly between spring and autumn. On average, significantly more fish were caught during the night (2.9 fish/hr) than during the day (1.3 fish/hr). Topmouth gudgeon, European grayling and pike-perch mostly moved downstream during the night, whereas roach, spirlin and bleak were the most frequent downstream moving fish during daytime. Downstream fish movement was positively related with turbidity, water temperature and discharge. The strong differences in seasonal and diurnal fish movement patterns suggest that fish damage can be strongly reduced by adaptive turbine and corridor management, for example by shutting down turbines at peak movements.},

Model-based analyses are well suited to rapidly identifying and evaluating alternative actions but often lack explicit linkages between habitat conditions and population outcomes. We provide an example of how spatially explicit population modeling can uniquely inform conservation planning by integrating changes in habitat conditions with population responses. Using a case study of the critically endangered Greater Sage-grouse in Canada, we integrated habitat selection maps, demography and demographic risk maps, movement, and behavior into a predictive individual-based modeling framework. We used this framework to simulate population dynamics, evaluate demographic sensitivities, assess source-sink dynamics, and compared the population gains from restoring different types (strengths) of sinks. Sensitivity analysis results underscored the need for multiple, simultaneous population recovery actions to stabilize the population, including improving chick and adult survival. Strong source-sink dynamics were an emergent property of simulations, driven by the maladaptive selection of habitats with low chick survival and nest success. Simulated habitat restorations improving chick survival conditions in strong sinks were more effective at increasing abundance than actions targeting all sinks, or removing sinks. Spatially explicit population modeling can be an informative means of predicting and comparing potential population responses to habitat restoration and population recovery options. Individual-based modeling can uniquely evaluate habitat-population dynamics and can be particularly useful for critically endangered species, when too few animals or time remains to conduct field experiments.},

We used observed arrival times for detected individuals and imputed arrival times for undetected individuals to assign covariate values in each reach. We found travel time was inversely related to river inflow in all reaches, yet survival was positively related to inflow only in reaches that transitioned from bidirectional tidal flows to unidirectional flow with increasing inflows. We also found that the probability of fish entering the interior Delta, a low-survival reach, declined as inflow increased. Our study illustrates how river inflows interact with tides to influence fish survival during the critical transition between freshwater and ocean environments. Furthermore, our analytical framework introduces new techniques to integrate formally over missing covariate values to quantify effects of time-varying covariates.},

abstract = {Archaeological data on the long history of interaction between indigenous people and salmon have rarely been applied to conservation management. When j oined with ethnohistoric records, archaeology provides an alternative conceptual view of the potential for sustainable harvests and can suggest possible social mechanisms for managing human behavior. Review of the $\sim$7,500-year-long fish bone record from two subregions of the Pacific Northwest shows remarkable stability in salmon use. As major changes in the ecological and social system occurred over this lengthy period, persistence in the fishery is not due simply to a lack of perturbation, but rather indicates resilience in the ecological-human system. Of several factors possibly contributing to resilience, low human population size and harvesting pressure, habitat enhancement, and suppression of competing predators do not appear to be of major importance. Flexible resource use, including human use of a range of local resources, many of which are linked in a food web with salmon, likely contributed to resilience. Most important were the beliefs and social institutions (including ownership, regulation, rituals, and monitoring) that placed restraints on salmon use as a common pool resource. In contrast, only a small fraction of our modern society relies economically on or has direct interaction with the fish, which limits our concern and willingness to fundamentally change behaviors that contribute to habitat degradation and loss, the main challenges facing salmon populations today. Salmon recovery efforts may benefit substantially from investing more resources into establishing links between community groups and actual fish populations, which would create a sense of proprietorship, one of the keys to resilience in the indigenous salmon fishery.

abstract = {Lower Granite Dam is the last dam that federally protected Snake River salmonids Oncorhynchus spp. must ascend during their spawning migration. The dam has an adult fish ladder equipped with a trapping system to facilitate fisheries research and hatchery broodstock collection. There are three possible passage routes through the adult ladder: trapped, shunted, and free passage. During the adult trapping season, all fish must swim through 0.305-m shunt pipes outfitted with PIT tag arrays that allow the selection of fish for trapping. Selected fish use the “trapped” route and are kept in a holding area for up to 20 h before being sampled and returned to the ladder. Unselected fish use the “shunted” route and immediately resume upstream migration after swimming through the pipes. When the trap is not in operation, the shunted route is inaccessible, and all fish use the “free passage” route to ascend the ladder without additional impediment. In 2016, a temporary change in ladder operations permitted free passage for a portion of the trapping season. Our study used this rare opportunity to evaluate how different passage routes affect in-ladder transit time and upstream homing success for five salmonid stocks: Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka; steelhead O. mykiss; and spring-, summer-, and fall-run Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha. In 2016, only Sockeye Salmon and spring- and summer-run Chinook Salmon were given access to free passage, and we found evidence that free passage increased subsequent detection at natal sites upstream. An expanded analysis of shunted versus trapped fish during the years 2012–2016 found no difference in rates of detection to home tributaries by route of passage for any of the five fish stocks examined.},

abstract = {Connectivity between freshwater habitats and marine areas is heavily obstructed by anthropogenic structures (e.g. weirs, pumping stations, sluices{\ldots}), leading to a high pressure on diadromous fish populations. A better understanding of fish migration behaviour in relation to these barriers is needed to take proper mitigation actions. We investigated the impact of migration barriers on downstream migrating European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) by tracking 50 acoustically tagged eels between July 2012 and March 2015 in a Belgian polder area. The study area was selected due to the presence of a wide range of migration barriers, such as two pumping stations, a weir and tidal sluices. These structures regulate the water level, resulting in discontinuous flow conditions. The results showed that migration was primarily nocturnal and discharge appeared to be the main trigger for migration in the polder. We also observed substantial delays and exploratory behaviour near barriers. Delays can have a serious impact on eels since their energy resources are limited for a successful trans-Atlantic migration. In addition, delays and exploratory behaviour can also increase predation and disease risk. The obtained knowledge can contribute to efficient management such as improved fish passage and guidance solutions.},

abstract = {Summer steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss may enter freshwater almost a year before spawning and potentially make long migrations (>1,000 km) to interior headwater habitats. However, in response to suboptimal freshwater habitat conditions (e.g., warmer water temperatures), adult summer steelhead may exhibit complex behaviors during upstream migration in the Columbia River basin. Steelhead may migrate upstream of their natal tributary (hereafter, referred to as “overshoot”) and spend days to several months before subsequently migrating downstream (hereafter, referred to as “fallback”) to their natal tributary to spawn. An expansion of an existing Bayesian patch occupancy model, derived from observations of adult steelhead that were PIT-tagged to estimate population-specific abundance upstream of the tagging location, incorporated downstream detection locations to estimate the abundance of overshoot fallbacks. Overshoot steelhead abundance at the tagging location was estimated based on the relationship between the number of known overshoot fallbacks (i.e., the number of steelhead that overshot and successfully migrated downstream to their natal tributary) and their model-estimated abundance. During the study period (2010–2017), the annual mean proportion of overshoot steelhead that successfully migrated downstream of the tagging location (Priest Rapids Dam) was 0.59 (SD = 0.14). The number of dams encountered by overshoot steelhead during their downstream migration was negatively correlated with their downstream migration success probability. Improved downstream passage survival for adult steelhead will increase the abundance of affected populations while reducing potential genetic introgression of upstream populations (i.e., strays). This is the first study to estimate the abundance of overshoot and fallback steelhead, providing the data necessary for scientists to estimate potential conservation benefits of improved downstream survival. For example, surface flow passage routes (e.g., sluiceways and temporary spillway weirs) are very effective in guiding and passing adult steelhead downstream of Columbia River hydroelectric projects and data from this assessment show that changes in dam operations throughout the downstream migration period may maximize conservation benefits.},

abstract = {We examined upstream migration patterns of adult Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in relation to environmental factors and two management actions (installation of a rock barrier at a distributary and managed pulse flows). Data was collected using a portable resistance board weir and a Vaki Riverwatcher system that provided accurate daily counts of fall-run Chinook Salmon on their spawning migration. Akaike's information criterion and multimodel inferential approaches, as well as generalized additive models, were used to assess the relative influence of water temperature, flow, moon illumination, weather, operation of a rock barrier, and managed pulse flows to explain the magnitude of daily counts and proportions of Chinook Salmon observed at the weir. Over the 12-year study period (2003–2014), we observed 38,206 Chinook Salmon. The installation of a rock barrier in the lower reaches of the San Joaquin River had positive and consistent influences on daily counts in the years it was installed. Although managed pulse flows to stimulate upstream migration have been used since the early 1990s, our analyses found managed pulse flows only appeared in the top generalized linear models in 2 of the 11 complete years of data analyzed. Managed pulse flows resulted in immediate increases in daily passages, but the response was brief and represented a small portion of the total run. A strong nonlinear response between migratory activity and discharge levels was observed for Chinook Salmon, indicating no additional increase in daily counts when pulse flows exceeded 20 m3/s. Current management requirements in the Stanislaus River exceed this level and adjustment should be considered based on the findings of this study, particularly given the need to balance beneficial uses of a limited water supply. This study provides a scientific approach to determine biologically relevant flow prescriptions for upstream migration of fish in regulated streams.

abstract = {In the face of climate change, achieving resilience of desirable aspects of food-energy-water (FEW) systems already strained by competing multi-scalar social objectives requires interdisciplinary approaches. This study is part of a larger effort exploring "Innovations in the Food-Energy-Water Nexus (INFEWS)" in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) through coordinated modeling and simulated management scenarios. Here, we focus on a case study and conceptual mapping of the Yakima River Basin (YRB), a sub-basin of the CRB. Previous research on FEW system management and resilience includes some attention to social dynamics (e.g., economic and governance systems); however, more attention to social drivers and outcomes is needed. Our goals are to identify several underutilized ways to incorporate social science perspectives into FEW nexus research and to explore how this interdisciplinary endeavor alters how we assess innovations and resilience in FEW systems. First, we investigate insights on FEW nexus resilience from the social sciences. Next, we delineate strategies for further incorporation of social considerations into FEW nexus research, including the use of social science perspectives and frameworks such as socio-ecological resilience and community capitals. Then, we examine a case study of the YRB, focusing on the historical development of the FEW nexus and innovations. We find that a resilience focus applied to the FEW nexus can inadvertently emphasize a status quo imposed by those already in power. Incorporating perspectives from the social sciences, which highlight issues related to inequality, power, and social justice, can address these shortcomings and inform future innovations. Finally, we use causal loop diagrams to explore the role of the social in the FEW nexus, and we suggest ways to incorporate social aspects into an existing stock and flow object-oriented modeling system. This project represents a starting point for a continued research agenda that incorporates social dynamics into FEW system resilience modeling and management in the CRB.},

abstract = {Unlike most anadromous salmonids, summer steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss overwinter in rivers rather than the ocean for 6-10 months prior to spring spawning. Overwintering in rivers may make summer steelhead more vulnerable to harvest and other mortality sources than are other anadromous populations, but there has been little systematic study of this life history strategy. Here, we used a large-scale radiotelemetry study to examine the overwintering behaviors and distributions of 26 summer steelhead stocks within the regulated lower Columbia-Snake River hydrosystem. Over 6 years, we monitored 5,939 fish, of which 3,399 successfully reached spawning tributaries or the upper Columbia River basin and were assigned to specific populations. An estimated 12.4% of fish that reached spawning areas overwintered at least partially within the hydrosystem (annual estimates = 6.8-19.6%), while the remainder overwintered in tributaries. Across all populations, later-arriving fish were more likely to overwinter in the hydrosystem; overwintering percentages ranged from less than 1% for fish tagged in June to over 40% for those tagged in October. Proportionately more interior-basin steelhead (Clearwater, Salmon, and Snake River metapopulations) overwintered in the hydrosystem than did fish from lower-river populations. Steelhead were distributed in mixed-stock assemblages throughout the hydrosystem during winter, usually in reservoirs closest to their home rivers but also in nonnatal tributaries. Overwintering fish moved upstream and downstream between reaches in all months; a nadir occurred in early January and peak egress into spawning tributaries was in March. The estimated survival to tributaries was higher for fish that overwintered in the hydrosystem (82%) than for fish that did not (62%); this difference was largely attributable to low winter harvest rates. Our results suggest that large main-stem habitats, including reservoirs, may be widely used by overwintering summer steelhead. The complex migration behaviors of steelhead indicate both the potential for adaptation and possible susceptibility to future river environment changes. {\textcopyright} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2008.},

These systems allowed us to determine the direction of fish movement with high detection efficiency and high precision in a dynamic stream environment. We describe an indirect method for deriving an estimate for detection efficiency and the associated variance that does not rely on a known number of fish passing the system. By using six antennas arranged in a longitudinal series of three arrays, we attained detection efficiencies for downstream- and upstream-moving fish exceeding 96% during high-flow periods and approached 100% during low-flow periods for the two interrogation systems we tested. Because these systems did not rely on structural components, such as bridges or culverts, they were readily adaptable to remote, natural stream sites. Because of built-in redundancy, these systems were able to perform even with a loss of one or more antennas owing to dislodgement or electrical failure. However, the reduction in redundancy resulted in decreased efficiency and precision and the potential loss of ability to determine the direction of fish movement. What we learned about these systems should be applicable to a wide variety of other antenna configurations and to other types of PIT tags and transceivers.},

@article{Quinn2016,
abstract = {In several groups of anadromous fishes, but especially the salmonids, some populations migrate from the ocean to fresh water many months prior to spawning. This “premature migration” reduces growth opportunities at sea, compels them to occupy much less productive freshwater habitats, and exposes them to extremes of flow and temperature, disease, and predation. We first review migration in salmonids and find great variation in timing patterns among and within species, relative to the timing of reproduction. Premature migration is widely distributed among species but not in all populations, and we propose two hypotheses to explain it. First, the fish may be making “the best of a bad situation” by entering early because access to suitable breeding sites is constrained seasonally by flow or temperature regimes, so they sacrifice growing opportunities at sea. Alternatively or additionally, some populations may be “balancing risks and benefits” as they trade off the benefits of growth at sea against the risk of mortality there. In this model, the reduced risk of mortality at sea must be balanced against the risk of mortality in freshwater habitats from thermal stress, disease, and predators. Premature migration may be favored where temperatures and flows are moderate or where lakes provide safety from predators and reduce energetic expenditure. Consistent with this hypothesis, early return is characteristic of larger, older salmonids (that would benefit less from additional time at sea to grow than would smaller fish). Finally, we consider the vulnerability of premature migrants to climate change and selective fisheries. Migration timing is an important part of the portfolio of phenotypic diversity that conveys resilience to species, population complexes, and the fisheries that depend on them. The premature migrants are often especially valued in fisheries and also often of particular conservation concern, and the phenomenon merits further research.},

Here, we recover, digitize, and analyze archival temperature measurements from the 1850s onward to investigate how and why water temperatures in the lower Columbia River are changing. To infill data gaps and explore changes, we develop regression models of daily historical Columbia River water temperature using time-lagged river flow and air temperature as the independent variables. Models were developed for three time periods (mid-19th, mid-20th, and early 21st century), using archival and modern measurements (1854–1876; 1938–present). Daily and monthly averaged root-mean-square errors overall are 0.89°C and 0.77°C, respectively for the 1938–2018 period. Results suggest that annual averaged water temperature increased by 2.2°C ± 0.2°C since the 1850s, a rate of 1.3°C ± 0.1°C/century. Increased water temperatures are seasonally dependent. An increase of approximately 2.0°C ± 0.2°C/century occurs in the July–Dec time-frame, while springtime trends are statistically insignificant. Rising temperatures change the probability of exceeding ecologically important thresholds; since the 1850s, the number of days with water temperatures over 20°C increased from $\sim$5 to 60 per year, while the number below 2°C decreased from $\sim$10 to 0 days/per year. Overall, the modern system is warmer, but exhibits less temperature variability. The reservoir system reduces sensitivity to short-term atmospheric forcing. Statistical experiments within our modeling framework suggest that increased water temperature is driven by warming air temperatures ($\sim$29%), altered river flow ($\sim$14%), and water resources management ($\sim$57%).},

Fallback can result in fish injury or death, migration delays, and biases in fishway counts, the primary index for escapement and the basis for production estimates and harvest quotas. We used radiotelemetry to calculate fallback percentages and rates, reascension percentages, biases in fishway escapement estimates due to fallback, and occurrence of behaviorally motivated fallback (correcting overshoot of natal sites) by spring–summer and fall Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha and steelhead O. mykiss. The study area included eight Columbia River and Snake River dams evaluated from 1996 to 2001. For all years combined, about 22% of spring–summer Chinook salmon, 15% of fall Chinook salmon, and 21% of steelhead fell back at least once at a dam. Fallback percentages for spring–summer Chinook salmon were generally highest at Bonneville and the Dalles dams and decreased at progressively upstream dams. Fallback rates for spring–summer Chinook salmon were positively correlated with river discharge. Fallback percentages for steelhead and fall Chinook salmon were less variable between years but were more variable between dams than those of spring–summer Chinook salmon. Reascension percentages at dams ranged widely between runs and sites and were negatively related to the number of fish that entered tributaries downstream from the fallback location. Fall Chinook salmon were the most likely to enter a downstream tributary after falling back, though this behavior was also observed in spring–summer Chinook salmon and steelhead. For all years and at all dams, fallback produced positive fishway count biases ranging from 1% to 16% for spring–summer Chinook salmon, 1% to 38% for fall Chinook salmon, and 1% to 12% for steelhead.},

abstract = {The decline in salmon and steelhead populations in the Columbia River Basin has been well documented, as have the decades-long, $9 billion restoration spending efforts by federal and state agencies. These efforts are mainly tied to Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates for recovery of wild, naturally-spawning threatened or endangered fish species. The impact of these efforts remains poorly understood; many observers, including the federal courts, have long been concerned by the lack of evidence of recovery. Most studies evaluating restoration efforts have examined individual projects for specific species, reaches, or life stages, which limits the ability to make broad inferences at the basin level. There is a need to ask: is there evidence of an overall increase in wild fish abundance associated with the totality of these recovery efforts? To that end, the current study estimates fixed-effects panel regression models of adult returns of four species. Results indicate that restoration spending combined with hatchery production are associated with substantial increases in returning adult fish. Evidence of benefits to wild fish alone, however, require indirect approaches given the commingling of restoration spending with spending on hatchery releases, the impacts of spending on hatchery fish survival, and the density dependence effects of hatchery releases. To accomplish this, the models' predicted adult returns (both hatchery and wild fish) attributed to both spending and hatchery releases are compared to independent estimates of returning hatchery fish based on hatchery survival estimates (smolt-to-adult ratios). The comparison finds the model-predicted levels of adult returns due to spending and hatchery releases do not exceed the survival-rate based estimates for hatcheries alone, so that we are unable to reject the hypothesis of no benefits to wild fish from the restoration spending.},

abstract = {Anadromous fishes achieve most of their lifetime growth at sea before returning to spawn in freshwater. However, populations of some species enter freshwater many months before spawning, apparently compromising growth opportunities at sea to access spawning grounds in conjunction with specific seasonal patterns of flow and temperature along the migratory route. The nutritional benefits of overwintering in the ocean may also be outweighed by a relatively dormant winter in colder river habitats. Modification of the thermal and hydrologic regimes of rivers (such as the Columbia River during the 20th century) might be expected to affect the abundance and life history patterns of such populations. This study reviews information on the migratory timing, abundance, and composition (wild versus hatchery) of summer-run (upriver) populations of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Columbia River basin with reference to environmental changes. Despite pronounced changes in the river's environment, the late summer migration-spring spawning persists as an overall pattern as it passes Bonneville Dam (the lowest on the Columbia River). However, the historic summer run's distinct bimodality (with early and late components) has gradually become unimodal. Upriver, other complex changes have taken place in migration timing: it now occurs earlier through some reaches of the river and periods of time, reflecting both the uneven physical changes over time and the complex behavior and population structure of steelhead. We were unable, therefore, to isolate the causal mechanisms or disentangle natural from anthropogenic influences. However, our research suggests that the change in the migration pattern for summer-run steelhead reflects a response to the challenges presented by a changing environment (temperature and flow) to genetically controlled life history patterns, the relative abundance of component populations, and the relative proportion of populations derived from hatchery production (which lately [1984-1999] accounted for an average 74% of the early run and 85% of the late run).},

abstract = {We related the arrival timing of adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) at a series of dams on the Columbia River (Bonneville, McNary, and Rock Island) and Snake River (Ice Harbor) to the changing flow and temperature regimes over the last several decades. The temperatures experienced by sockeye salmon have increased in the lower but not upper reaches of the system, and the flows experienced by the fish have decreased. The Bonneville-McNary travel rate increased from about 22 to 49 km/day, and sockeye salmon now pass McNary Dam about 11 days earlier than in 1954. Both travel rate and arrival date were correlated with temperature increases and flow decreases at McNary during that period. Sockeye salmon arrival at Rock Island Dam (14 days earlier from 1933 to 1994) was also correlated with temperature and flow there. However, the travel rate between McNary and Rock Island dams did not change from 1955 to 1994, despite a decrease in estimated water velocity from 85 to 23 km/day. Sockeye salmon arrival at Ice Harbor Dam has sometimes been bimodal; the first mode's date has not changed, but annual mean dates have been positively correlated with flow and negatively with temperature.},

To make comparisons with other packages available, parameter estimation is also permitted via direct search routines available in 'optim'. The MARSS package allows data to contain missing values and allows a wide variety of model structures and constraints to be specified (such as fixed or shared parameters). In addition to model-fitting, the package provides bootstrap routines for simulating data and generating confidence intervals, and multiple options for calculating model selection criteria (such as AIC).},

abstract = {Anadromous fishes often use various survival tactics while migrating through main stem rivers to successfully reach spawning grounds and reproduce. Mixed-stock assemblages of anadromous adult summer steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss re-enter the Columbia River from late spring through fall including the period of peak summer water temperatures, and previous studies suggest that stocks alter migratory behaviour in response to warm temperatures by seeking cool water refuges. We combined parentage-based tagging with mixed stock analyses to test whether steelhead use a non-natal tributary (Deschutes River, OR, USA) as a thermal refuge and if this migratory behaviour is associated with stock-specific run-timing. Results collected over two migration years indicated that out-of-basin fish in the Deschutes River were disproportionately from specific stocks in the Snake River (Salmon and Grande Ronde) that had migrated through the main stem Columbia River when water temperatures exceeded 21 C. Stocks migrating through the main stem river during cooler temperature periods were either less frequent (Clearwater River), or not encountered (lower Snake River) in the Deschutes River. This study facilitates an improved understanding of stock-specific migratory characteristics associated with environmental conditions in this system. Results potentially affect fisheries management, hatchery protocols, cool-water refuge maintenance, and conservation of wild Deschutes River populations.},

abstract = {Hydrologic connectivity ( sensu Pringle, 2001) is used here in an\necological context to refer to water-mediated transfer of matter,\nenergy and/or organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic\ncycle. Hydrologic connectivity is essential to the ecological integrity\nof the landscape, and reduction or enhancement of this property by\nhumans can have major negative environmental effects. Some of these\neffects are immediate, localized and, therefore, obvious. For example,\nwith respect to migratory fish, a given dam may act to reduce hydrologic\nconnectivity (by preventing or impeding migration up or downstream),\nwhereas interbasin river transfers enhance this property by allowing\nthe dispersal of fish into river basins outside of their range. Less\nobvious, are alterations in hydrologic connectivity that exhibit\na time lag and manifest themselves at geographic locations far from\nthe source of disturbance. An example concerns the cumulative effect\nof dams on transport of the inorganic dissolved solute silica. Dams\nand associated impoundments can reduce the transport of this compound,\nwhich becomes deposited in the bottoms of reservoirs (Humborg et\nal ., 2000). The cumulative effects of many dams along a river can\npotentially result in a reduction in the amount of silica delivered\nto coastal waters, with consequent negative effects on coastal food\nweb structure that contribute to eutrophication (Justic et al .,\n1995; Turner et al ., 1998). Management and policy decisions regarding\nland-use activities and hydropower development are often made in\nthe absence of adequate information on hydrologic connectivity in\nthe landscape. Our current knowledge of how this property maintains\nthe ecological integrity of 'natural' ecosystems is poor due to:\n(1) the inherent complexity of water movement within and between\nthe atmosphere and surface-subsurface systems; and (2) the extent\nand magnitude of human alterations, which often occur before we understand\nhow hydrologic connectivity affects ecological patterns in the landscape\n(Pringle and Triska, 2000). Hydrologic connectivity is being altered\nat a rate unprecedented in geologic history, contributing to dramatic\nlosses in global aquatic biodiversity and associated ecosystem integrity\n(e.g. Dudgeon, 2000; Pringle et al ., 2000; Rosenberg et al ., 2000).\nHumans have already appropriated one-half of the accessible global\nfreshwater runoff and this could climb to 70% by 2025 (Postel et\nal ., 1996).(...)},

"Spill operations targeting juvenile salmon and steelhead generally start April 3 on the lower Snake River and April 10 on the lower Columbia River. USACE uses these operations to decrease the time it takes juvenile salmon and steelhead to move through the system of dams to the Pacific Ocean as well as provide another non-turbine passage route. Many of the dams also have alternative ways to move past the dams.

This year, four projects on the lower Snake River and McNary Dam on the Columbia River will also begin spilling four hours each day through surface passage routes to primarily assist migrating adult steelhead starting March 1. Beginning March 21, those projects, plus John Day Dam on the Columbia River, will begin spilling through surface passage routes 24 hours each day until regular spring spill begins with the goal of providing additional benefits for both juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead."},

As poikilotherms, temperature is described as the overwhelming environmental influence that determines what life history options occur. The different populations represent ecological types referred to as spring-, summer-, fall, and winter-run segments, as well as stream- and ocean-type, or stream- and ocean-maturing life history forms. However, they are more correctly described as a continuum of forms that fall along a temporal cline related to incubation and rearing temperatures that determine spawn timing and juvenile residence patterns. Population structure of chinook salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin, therefore, is the reflection of the genetic composition of the founding source or sources within the respective region, shaped by the environment, principally temperature, that defines life history evolutionary strategy to maximize fitness under the conditions delineated. The key in developing an effective recovery program for chinook salmon and steelhead is to recognize that measures taken must address the genetic and biological requirements of the population unit within the environmental template identified.},

The occurrence, type, and severity of streamflow alteration differed markedly between arid and wet climates. Biological assessments conducted on a subset of these streams showed that, relative to eight chemical and physical covariates, diminished flow magnitudes were the primary predictors of biological integrity for fish and macroinvertebrate communities. In addition, the likelihood of biological impairment doubled with increasing severity of diminished streamflows. Among streams with diminished flow magnitudes, increasingly common fish and macroinvertebrate taxa possessed traits characteristic of lake or pond habitats, including a preference for fine-grained substrates and slow-moving currents, as well as the ability to temporarily leave the aquatic environment. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},
